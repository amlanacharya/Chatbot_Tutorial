# Module 14: From Chatbots to Agents - Making the Leap

This module explores the evolution from conversational chatbots to goal-oriented AI agents. You'll learn the key architectural differences and implement a basic agent framework that can plan and execute tasks using tools.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental differences between chatbots and agents
- Learn how to implement planning capabilities in AI systems
- Build a tool-using framework for agents
- Create a state management system beyond simple conversation history
- Implement a decision-making loop for autonomous task execution

## Files in this Module

- `agent_framework.py` - Core implementation of the agent framework
- `tools.py` - Implementation of tools that the agent can use
- `agent_demo.py` - A demonstration script showing the agent in action
- `exercises.md` - Exercises to practice building and extending agents

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of LLM-based chatbots (Modules 1-7)
- Familiarity with LangChain concepts (Modules 8-9)
- Basic knowledge of structured output parsing

## Getting Started

1. Review the code in `agent_framework.py` to understand the agent architecture
2. Explore the available tools in `tools.py`
3. Run `agent_demo.py` to see the agent in action
4. Complete the exercises in `exercises.md` to build your own agent extensions

## Key Concepts

- **Agent Loop**: The sense-think-act cycle that drives agent behavior
- **Planning**: Breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Tool Use**: Enabling the agent to interact with external systems
- **State Management**: Tracking progress and knowledge beyond conversation history
- **Decision Making**: Implementing logic for choosing appropriate actions

Remember: Every agent has conversational abilities (like a chatbot), but not every chatbot has agentic capabilities!
