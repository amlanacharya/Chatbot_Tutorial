# Module 11: Advanced Local Model Deployment

This module covers advanced techniques for deploying local language models, focusing on optimization, quantization, and handling different model architectures.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding model formats and quantization techniques
- Optimizing models for CPU and GPU hardware
- Handling different model architectures and their requirements
- Mastering prompt formatting for different model families
- Benchmarking and comparing model performance

## Prerequisites

Before running this module, make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install torch transformers gradio accelerate bitsandbytes psutil
```

For optimal performance with quantized models:

```bash
pip install bitsandbytes>=0.40.0
```

## Hardware Considerations

Advanced model deployment techniques are especially important when dealing with hardware constraints:

- **CPU Deployment**: Learn techniques to optimize inference on CPU-only machines
- **Consumer GPUs**: Run larger models on limited VRAM (4-8GB) using quantization
- **High-end GPUs**: Maximize throughput and minimize latency on powerful hardware

## Model Formats and Quantization

The module covers various model formats and quantization techniques:

### Model Formats
- PyTorch (.bin/.pt)
- ONNX (.onnx)
- TensorRT
- GPTQ
- AWQ

### Quantization Techniques
- FP32 (32-bit floating point)
- FP16 (16-bit floating point)
- BF16 (Brain Floating Point)
- INT8 (8-bit integer)
- INT4 (4-bit integer)
- Mixed precision

## Hardware Optimization

Learn specific techniques for optimizing models on different hardware:

### CPU Optimization
- Thread optimization
- Memory mapping
- Quantization
- Batch processing
- CPU-specific libraries

### GPU Optimization
- Precision selection
- Memory management
- Batch size tuning
- Flash Attention
- Tensor parallelism
- KV cache management

## Model Architectures

Understand how to handle different model architectures:

- Decoder-Only (GPT-style)
- Encoder-Only (BERT-style)
- Encoder-Decoder (T5-style)
- Mixture of Experts (MoE)
- Retrieval-Augmented Models
- Multi-Modal Models

## Prompt Formatting

Master prompt formatting for different model families:

- LLaMA/Llama 2 Format
- Mistral Format
- ChatML Format
- Vicuna/FastChat Format
- Alpaca Format
- TinyLlama Format
- Gemma Format

## Running the Module

To run this module:

```bash
python module11.py
```

This will:
1. Display information about advanced model deployment techniques
2. Explain model formats and quantization
3. Provide guidance on hardware optimization
4. Explain different model architectures
5. Show prompt formatting for different models
6. Ask if you want to launch the benchmarking interface

## Using the Benchmarking Interface

If you choose to launch the benchmarking interface, you'll have access to:

1. **System Information**: View details about your hardware
2. **Single Model Benchmark**: Test a model with different quantization settings
3. **Model Comparison**: Compare two models with different configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Out of Memory Errors with 4-bit Quantization**:
   - Make sure you have the latest version of bitsandbytes
   - Some models may not be compatible with 4-bit quantization
   - Try 8-bit quantization instead

2. **Slow CPU Inference**:
   - Use smaller models (1-2B parameters)
   - Enable INT8 quantization
   - Consider ONNX runtime for better performance

3. **Model Format Compatibility**:
   - Not all models support all quantization techniques
   - Check the model card on Hugging Face for compatibility information

4. **Prompt Formatting Errors**:
   - Different model families require specific prompt formats
   - Use the built-in chat templates when available
   - Check model documentation for the expected format

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you can:

1. Experiment with different quantization techniques for your specific use case
2. Convert models to optimized formats like ONNX for deployment
3. Implement advanced techniques like model distillation or pruning
4. Explore specialized deployment frameworks like ONNX Runtime or TensorRT
